# Class Introduction

Topics

1. Data Manipulation
2. Data Visualization
3. Functional Programming
4. Data Modeling
5. Text Analysis

Incorporating Intermediate R Techniques

## Expectations

By taking this course, we assume you have a working knowledge of the following...

1. Base R and RStudio Functionality
2. Basic 'tidy' concepts
3. Introductory Statistics
4. Dad Jokes

Give it a shot, if its too much or too little, will not be offended if you leave.

Its okay to struggle.

## Distance Learning Challenges

1. Expected to be in person
2. Unknown number of students in class
3. Asking Questions - both verbally and in chat
4. How to know if you are following along
5. Speed of going through the material

## Class Structure

1. 7 HOURS!
2. ~ 50:10 Work to break - 1 HR Lunch
3. We will ask for feedback to get a feel for understanding 
4. We will try to answer questions in chat

## Learning Recommendations

1. Use RMD files provided in repo (will get this this later)
2. Take notes with comments
3. Execute code along with us
4. Ask questions in chat

## Class Introductions 

Might pass on this given the classroom size.

Around the (virtual) room:

- Where you are from:
- Who you work for:
- How you are involved in Data Science:
    (ie - statistics, coding, application building, manager, etc)
<!-- - Why you sat in that seat: -->
- R Coding Experience
- Favorite sports team:
